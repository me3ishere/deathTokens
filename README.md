## DeathTokens Minecraft Plugin
## Description

The DeathTokens plugin is designed to enhance gameplay in Minecraft by introducing a token system that rewards players upon murder. When a player kills another player, they receive a kill token which can be used to redeem various rewards or benefits.
Features

    Upon player kill, a kill token is rewarded.
    Players can use death tokens to access rewards or benefits.
    Customizable rewards and benefits.
    Easy configuration and setup.

## Installation

    Import the repository to intellij
    Use maven install

## Usage

    Upon player kill, the murderer is awarded a kill token.
    Players can use the kill token by interacting with a designated NPC or block.

## Configuration

  I have not yet implemented any configuration because the plugin is only used on one server. If for some reason someone wants to use it on a different server just add an issue asking for configuration and I will try to fix it.

## Commands

  There are no commands so far due to the plugin only having one use.
